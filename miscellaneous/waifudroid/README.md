## Description
Lockdowns have really made me feel lonely... so I made something that hopefully will keep me company! My waifu bot is really awesome, she does everything I tell her to. She knows all of my secrets and she won't tell anyone else. You can talk to her, her name is Nadenka#4738. She's shy though, so she will only talk on DMs.
